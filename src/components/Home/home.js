      <h2>Importance of Handlooms</h2>
      <p>
        Handloom sarees are a traditional textile art of Bangladesh and India.
        The production of handloom saris is important for economic development
        in rural India. Completion of a single sari takes two to three days of
        work. Several regions have their own traditional styles of weaving
        handloom sarees. 1. Handloom. A 'handloom' is a loom that is used to
        weave cloth without the use of any electricity. Hand weaving is done on
        pit looms or frame looms generally located in weavers' homes. Weaving is
        primarily the interlacing of two sets of yarn â€“ the warp (length) and
        the weft (width). 2. Handloom sector is a symbol of the country's
        glorious cultural heritage and an important source of livelihood in the
        country. The sector is key to women empowerment as over 70% of handloom
        weavers and allied workers are women.
