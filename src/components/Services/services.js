      <p>
        Origins of Handloom Weaving: The origins of handloom weaving can be
        traced back to the Neolithic era, where early humans began experimenting
        with interlacing plant fibers to create basic fabrics. As civilization
        progressed, handloom weaving techniques developed independently in
        different regions of the world: 1. Founder of Handlooms: The origins of
        handloom in the Indian subcontinent may be traced back to the Indus
        Valley Civilization, according to archaeological findings. Weavers
        received royal support with the rise of the Mughal empire, resulting in
        the invention of new textiles such as 'Mulmul,' 'Benarsi Brocade,' and
        'Jamawar,' among others.. 2. First Handloom Cloth in India: Pochampally
        saree The Pochampally saree is the first handloom cloth patented in
        India. 3. India's Famous Handloom: Varanasi is celebrated for its
        exquisite handloom products, particularly the Benarasi silk sarees, zari
        embroidery, and brocades. It is a hub for weaving crafts, where skilled
        artisans weave gold and silver threads into fabrics commonly chosen for
        Indian weddings The handloom industry produces a wide range of unique
        designs and patterns. The handloom fabrics are known for their intricate
        designs, vibrant colors, and high quality. The products are often valued
        for their aesthetic appeal and cultural significance.

      <h2>Awareness of handlooms</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Plan and design:</b> Handloom allows the weaver to have total control
        of the creative process which encourages them to explore new ideas and
        come up with innovative weaving patterns and designs. On the other hand,
        power looms are repetitive and only allow the weaver to create a replica
        of one particular design. Crafting A Greener.

        <b>Canvas:</b> A Vision For Sustainable Handloom Trends In 2024 And
        Beyond. In the intricate world of handloom textiles, 2024 beckons as a
        pivotal year where sustainability takes center stage, steering the
        industry towards a conscious and eco-friendly future.

      <h2>Challenges to Handlooms:</h2>
      <p>
        They could not get sufficient supply of raw cotton which was sent to
        England for their industries after American world war The prices of raw
        cotton shot up and Indian weavers were forced to buy raw cotton at
        exorbitant prices. In most cases, they were unable to pay. Other factors
        such as rapid and manifold increase in the prices of raw material, poor
        awareness of buying patterns/trends in the market, inadequate variety in
        designs, low grade technology, and high cost of pro· duction have led to
        handlooms becoming an unviable proposition. Climate change is a major
        threat to the planet and its life forms, as it causes extreme weather
        events, sea level rise, melting of ice caps, and shifts in ecosystems.
        To limit global warming to 2°C or less, we need to reduce greenhouse gas
        emissions and increase the use of renewable energy sources. The study
        found that the main problems faced are lack of working capital,
        increasing price of raw materials, stiff competition from the power loom
        sector, lack of organizational capacity, and lack of policy support and
        it also indicates that the handloom weavers are not happy with the
        financial benefits of this ....
